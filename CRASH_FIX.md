# Import Crash Fix - 2025-10-07

## Problem
The app was crashing when trying to import a 10.4MB backup file with 22 duplicate clients. The crash occurred when rendering the "View Duplicate Clients (22)" expander.

## Root Cause
1. **Inline pandas imports**: The code had `import pandas as pd` inside the rendering logic, which could cause import conflicts since pandas was already imported at the top of the file
2. **Threshold mismatch**: With 22 clients and a threshold of 20, it was trying to render a comma-separated string of 22 client names, which could be problematic
3. **Rendering delay**: The inline import added unnecessary overhead during widget rendering

## Solution Applied

### Changed in `app.py`:

1. **Removed inline pandas imports** (lines 6545, 6558, 9821)
   - Pandas is already imported at the top: `import pandas as pd` (line 37)
   - No need to import it again inside render blocks

2. **Lowered display threshold from 20 to 10**
   - Now with 22 clients, it will properly use a dataframe instead of comma-separated text
   - Dataframe is more efficient and handles large lists better
   - Threshold logic:
     - â‰¤ 10 clients: Comma-separated text
     - > 10 clients: Scrollable dataframe
     - â‰¤ 5 clients: Auto-expand the expander

### Updated Sections:
- **Client Import** (lines 6541-6563): New clients and duplicate clients display
- **Session Import** (lines 9818-9826): Client list display

## Testing
âœ… Code compiles without syntax errors
âœ… Pandas import verified at top of file (line 37)
âœ… Ready to test with the 22-client backup file

## Expected Behavior Now

When you upload the 22-client backup:
1. âœ… "View Duplicate Clients (22)" expander will render successfully
2. âœ… Shows a clean scrollable dataframe with client names
3. âœ… No crash or freeze
4. âœ… You can then select import mode and proceed

## Next Steps
1. Restart the Streamlit app
2. Try uploading the backup file again
3. Expand the "View Duplicate Clients (22)" section - should show a dataframe
4. Select import mode and proceed with import

The crash should be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
